         <h3>The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. I suggest you drop it, <span class="characterName">{{Character1}} </span>. Your shields were failing, sir. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Ensign <span class="characterName">{{Character2}} </span>! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." A surprise party? <span class="characterName">{{Character2}} </span>, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Sorry, <span class="characterName">{{Character1}} </span>. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, <span class="characterName">{{Character1}} </span>. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Computer, lights up! <span class="characterName">{{Character2}} </span>, why are we out here chasing comets? My oath is between Captain <span class="characterName">{{Character1}} </span> and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? What? We're not at all alike! Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you.</h3>

<p> I swallowed a bug. This may come as a shock, but I'm actually not very good at talking to <span class="characterName">{{Character2}} </span>. It's just a long cultural tradition of raging insincerity. The news isn't there to tell you what happened. It's there to tell you what it wants you to hear or what it thinks you want to hear. I figure, if I'm responsible for the end of the world, I get to name it. </p>
<p> When I kiss <span class="characterName">{{Character2}} </span>, you don't wake up from a deep sleep and live happily ever after. I told him that I loved him, I kissed him, and I killed him. Don't care much for fancy parties. Too rough. I gave birth to a pterodactyl. Okay, uh, I'm lost. I'm angry. And I'm armed. In my world, we have people in chains, and we can ride them like ponies. I'm a comfortador also. Love keeps her in the air when she ought to fall down. You're a hell of a woman. Shh! No programs, don't use that word. Just be Buffy. </p>
<p> We live in a space ship, dear. All the protein, vitamins and carbs of your grandma's best turkey dinner, plus fifteen percent alcohol. Military people don't make out with science people. This distress call wouldn't be taking place in someone's pants, would it? What gives you the right to suck face with your demon lover again? Did the primary buffer panel just fall off my Gorram ship for no apparent reason? The only way some people can find a purpose in life is by becoming obsessed with demons. </p>
